Notes:
===========================================
AutoSplitting:
- If You have problems to setup Extencion visit: https://github.com/neimex23/HitCounterManager/wiki

- To activate any autosplitting you should select in main program "Game to Split".

- To Auto initialize Timer should select in main program "Game to Split" and check the game in Configuration AutoSplitter AutoTimer

- Is recommended to configure everything before setting the game to spliter, to avoid autosplitting

-Depends on Configurable Autosplit, the addons autosplitting a split (+1 in the actually position), 
regardless of what is written on them

- When an event of autosplit happens, an internal variable is set, for evit that event is repit. 
Use the "Reset Run" button or Shortcut, to reset this state.

- If you have set "GameToSplit'' and add a position trigger, be careful with autosplinting.

- AutoTimer with RealTime Method in Celeste only start timer when join into a level, don't stop after this.

- If you want to auto reset internal flags to split all Pantheon bosses in a hollow autosplitter.
If you want play P1+P2+P3+P4 to play P5 after, or P5 to play P1....P4 after 
You should check "Grey Prince Zote" if you run, have this boss or not.
(Turn on/off depending the case)

- Currently Elden Ring is only supported with Easy Anti-Cheat disabled.
To disable Easy Anti-Cheat, navigate to "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game"
Launching the game from "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game\eldenring.exe" will run elden ring without EAC.

- Split by Attributes and some custom flags in DS3 dont work on versions previous to 1.15

- ASL Method can read whatever ASL file (AutoSplit Language to Livesplit) and split with them. Don't use ASL that does not have autospliting and 
if the game is into this plugin Sekiro,ds1,ds2,etc.
Browse the file with .asl extension and click on "Update Script" if this dont show configuration after 5-10 seconds.
